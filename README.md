# find-your-place
Application which provides informations about countries around the world and current weather in capital city of selected one.
There are two ways of getting informations. Selecting country by mouse hovering and clicking or typing country name in input field.
To built I used an SVG world map from amcharts.com and two different API's from restcountries.eu and openweather.com.
App is responsive and also works pretty good on mobile devices, but it's better to toogle to landscape view ;)
